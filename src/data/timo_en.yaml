title: "Javascript Developer Timo Zöller"
introduction: "Hi, I'm Timo. For seven years now I have worked as a frontend developer and five years ago I specialized to mainly Javascript single-page applications and styleguide driven frontend architectures. I worked on big customer relationship systems and I like it when my code helps other people in their daily work. I enjoy working environments where people cooperate as equals to maintain an open and responsible working climate. I would love to work with you - if you are interested in a collaboration please send me an [email](mailto:timo@pixelkritzel.de) or drop me a call ([+49 171 150 555 7](tel:49-171-1505557))."

      description: Architecture, implementation and design development for the new implementation of a large existing application. One main concern was the documentation of the frontend in form of a *living styleguide*  enabling backend developers to use it without any further knowledge of HTML or CSS. The frontend components had to be completely configurable by a HTML-API. The best comparision would be that I developed something similar to a company tailored Twitter Bootstrap. The browser support had to involve the IE8. Furthermore I developed Backbone.js components, custom jQuery-Plugins and a mobile Ember.js app.
